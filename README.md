# Hi, my names Dan! #

<br>
<br>

### 🚌 Interests 🎸 ###
- I would say I am pretty good at coding (I have lots of experience) in C++, C#, Python, HTML, SQL, Bash, Java, and Koltin. I have done projects in (meaning i've worked with before, can do but do not prefer) R, CSS, Perl, Assembly, and I have made a few Unity Game replicating projects. (All for classes at some point)

<br>
  
### Me ### 
- I’m currently in school (Hopefully finishing up soon) and working, learning more about programming everyday.

<br>
  
### Looking For Work ### 
- I’m looking to work on any remote programming projects I may be able to help with, I know I can get most things done (properly) and if I can help, I always love to try!
